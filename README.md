## Summary
***Skylighter*** is a project I made with Team 2 at HackMT in 2024, an annual 36 hour hack-a-thon & project expo.

The game is a mostly finished project in regards to features, and can be expanded upon further with ease thanks to the overall reusable plug-and-place assets.
It makes use of the open source Godot Engine in version 4.2.1 as well as a variety of open source assets.

## Contributions
During this project, I contributed in several ways. I produced:

- A scene manager to effectively swap between scenes using simple transitions
- A variety of menus and overlays, such as the main menu, pause menu, win notification, and credits menu.
- A setup of audio, in which the buttons sound when pressed, the scenes play background music, and the player makes sounds based on movement.
